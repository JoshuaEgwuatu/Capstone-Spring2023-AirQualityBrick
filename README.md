# Citizen Air Quality Sensor

## Executive Summary

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The goal of this project is a replicable device that accepts and operates multiple air quality sensors independently with a selection of interchangeable sensor options for local data collection.  Air quality is vital to maintaining life on Earth.  Poor air quality can result in a slew of health problems such as heart disease and lung cancer.  In the modern age, humanity pushes the levels of pollution in the world to unprecedented levels as compared to the pre-industrial era.  This pollution affects the very air that all living things rely on to survive.  This perspective on the negative repercussions of polluting the air and Earth is what led to this team’s proposition of a device that allows everyday citizens to see what pollutants blight their communities.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are already services that exist to alleviate this problem, however, the services do not fulfill the solution to a high degree.  The biggest of these services would be the Air Quality Index (AQI) provided by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.  The AQI takes in data from sensors placed systematically all across the country and in highly populated areas.  This data is then aggregated together to fill in any regions that were not explicitly sampled from a sensor directly.  The issue derives from that last sentence.  Because it is not reasonable or cost-effective for these services to place sensors everywhere, the readings that are received from these sensors may not be accurate in any given place.  For a community wanting a detailed view into the air quality of their chosen area, they would require more concrete sources of data.  It is here where the team’s proposed device comes in to provide an easy-to-use, solar-powered, easily replicable, and low-cost modular system that uses multiple sensors to gather data on different pollutants.

## Project Demonstration & Images

Give a link to a video of the project being demonstrated. The video should be hosted on the capstone youtube.

Below the video link show some well-taken, appropriately sized images of the project.


## About Us

### Team

Give a brief bio for each team member and their broad contribution to the project (no need to be terribly specifc).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of the members on the team have studied over various circuits and how to implement them to do what the developer wants it to.
Alejandro Moore, has had some experience in PCB circuit design, analysis, and manufacturing.  Knowing what is the correct component to the system and analyzing how it should be used are things that will be needed in order to understand and record the design process. He has also had some experience in BNC cable installation and other types of wires. Learning these concepts has given a plethora of resources that can be shared with the team if needed. He is aware that the team members have other skills that can also be used within this project. This is beneficial for the functionality of the team, because it can help the others learn the concept and further the process of the project.

### Faculty Supervisor

Our supervisor is Dr. Jefferey Austin.

### Stakeholders

Tell a bit about the customer for the project. Also discuss any other groups (specific or general) that are expected to be impacted by the project.

The customer for this product is also the same person, Dr. Jefferey Austin. Another steakholder within this course is our professor, Dr. Jessie Roberts. The team will be in contact with both teachers as we proceed within the design.


## Repo Organization

Give the layout of the repo and what can be found where. Make it easy on those who are interested by making the headings of the various things in this section clickable links to the relevant folder or file in the repo.


### Reports

The reports will conist of a Bill of Materials (BOM), Schematic, and List of Contraints and Speficiations.

### Documentation

Signoffs and Design Documents will be placed in the Documentation Folder.

### Software

The Pseudo Code and other Software components for the project will be placed in Software.
