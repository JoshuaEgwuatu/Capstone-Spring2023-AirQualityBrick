# Citizen Air Quality Sensor

## Executive Summary

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The goal of this project is a replicable device that accepts and operates multiple air quality sensors independently with a selection of interchangeable sensor options for local data collection.  Air quality is vital to maintaining life on Earth.  Poor air quality can result in a slew of health problems such as heart disease and lung cancer.  In the modern age, humanity pushes the levels of pollution in the world to unprecedented levels as compared to the pre-industrial era.  This pollution affects the very air that all living things rely on to survive.  This perspective on the negative repercussions of polluting the air and Earth is what led to this team’s proposition of a device that allows everyday citizens to see what pollutants blight their communities.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are already services that exist to alleviate this problem, however, the services do not fulfill the solution to a high degree.  The biggest of these services would be the Air Quality Index (AQI) provided by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.  The AQI takes in data from sensors placed systematically all across the country and in highly populated areas.  This data is then aggregated together to fill in any regions that were not explicitly sampled from a sensor directly.  The issue derives from that last sentence.  Because it is not reasonable or cost-effective for these services to place sensors everywhere, the readings that are received from these sensors may not be accurate in any given place.  For a community wanting a detailed view into the air quality of their chosen area, they would require more concrete sources of data.  It is here where the team’s proposed device comes in to provide an easy-to-use, solar-powered, easily replicable, and low-cost modular system that uses multiple sensors to gather data on different pollutants.
