## POWER
1. Operate using battery power
2. Operate using AC mains power
3. Supply 5 V to the Arduino through a USB input.
4. Supply appropriate voltages to sensors.

## SAMPLING AND INTERFACING SENSORS
1. The sensor will transfer the measured data to the microcontroller via the interface.
2. Sample at a minimum of 2 Hz.

## MICROCONTROLLER
1. Store data onto a USB flash drive.
2. Receive analog voltage, analog current, and digital data from the interface.
3. Send data to the Communication subsystem.

## COMMUNICATION
1. Receive data from the Microcontroller, format the data, and send the data through the use of
Wi-fi to be displayed on a terminal.

## WEB AND WIRELESS
1. Receive data from the device and have a simple display in a numeric form
