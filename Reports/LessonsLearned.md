# Lessons Learned

## Alejandro Moore
### Reflect on the project, both technical and organizational. What went well? What didn’t go well?
Overall, the team made an exceptional amount of progress for this project. In the beginning (CAPSTONE I), realizing the scope of this project took a little while but by the time it was finalized with both our customer and professor, we were ecstatic to start building this device. There are many things that did go well during that time. Our in person presentations at each checkpoint down the line mostly went well. Our Project Proposal, Conceptual Design, and Minimal Functionality Assignments were all passed as well. In a technical sense, when our team did meet in person, communication was strong and the vision for every assignment was the general consensus for all the members. During the whole course, there were some things that did not go well or even expected. Some of the documents that were due for each team member took a longer time than anticipated. With my own signoff analyzing the Sensor subsystem, it took me several weeks for it to meet the expectations of our customer/supervisor. Thus, leaving no other window of time before the final presentation to order the sensors that were essential to the project design. All in all, even though the sensors were not ordered, the project came out to meet most of the constraints stated at the beginning of the course.

### What unanticipated problems occurred?
I had enveloped an accumulation of issues while building the Air Quality device. As mentioned before, my signoff validation took me longer than I had expected. The reason for this is mostly because of my difficulty seeing the vision of what the customer wanted for this Sensor Signoff. Many subsections within the document were added later on and took time to research and summarize. 

### What would you do differently if you were to do it over again?
There are many things I would do differently if I had the opportunity for the class. First, I would communicate with the members of the team to understand the importance of meeting together outside of the scheduled meeting routine with our customer. This would make the time for every assignment due for the course be used more efficiently. Also, I would have spent a ton of more time doing more work for the signoff document that I was responsible for. I did not realize the amount of time to be allocated for this one document for it to be valid before purchase.

### What “best practices” have you identified?
The best practices I have noticed through this course would be to make sure everyone, including the professor and customer is on the same page. As a team, it is their own responsibility to communicate correctly and effectively in order to explain a concept that both the engineer and layman can understand. Not only meeting outside of regular meetings with the teacher and customer, but also keeping track of what work has been and is being done at that time will give the group a better analysis of the situation at hand.

### What words of wisdom would you pass on to future students?
It is important to know what type of people you are going to work with for this project. Since this project is an option to be on your own resume, it is also paramount that a high level of seriousness and motivation must be executed. Doing the best you can for your grade as well as the team’s grade is the best case scenario for this course.

### What new knowledge or skills did you acquire throughout capstone?
I have learned many things over the course of our CAPSTONE project. One thing I learned is if I do not know the specifics on what the customer would want for a subsystem of the project, it makes it more difficult to know what to build or even research. Understanding the functionality of the subsystem that’s assigned to a team member can help better realize what the building block of the project should look like. For me, I didn’t know there are classifications for sensors that detect gasses in its location. After researching the advantages and disadvantages of each type, I could figure out which one works best for the project accomplishments.
