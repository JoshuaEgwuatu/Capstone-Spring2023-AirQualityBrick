# Lessons Learned

### Reflect on the project, both technical and organizational. What went well? What didn’t go well?
Overall, the team made an exceptional amount of progress for this project. In the beginning (CAPSTONE I), realizing the scope of this project took a little while but by the time it was finalized with both our customer and professor, we were ecstatic to start building this device. There are many things that did go well during that time. Our in person presentations at each checkpoint down the line mostly went well. Our Project Proposal, Conceptual Design, and Minimal Functionality Assignments were all passed as well. In a technical sense, when our team did meet in person, communication was strong and the vision for every assignment was the general consensus for all the members. During the whole course, there were some things that did not go well or even expected. Some of the documents that were due for each team member took a longer time than anticipated. With my own signoff analyzing the Sensor subsystem, it took me several weeks for it to meet the expectations of our customer/supervisor. Thus, leaving no other window of time before the final presentation to order the sensors that were essential to the project design. All in all, even though the sensors were not ordered, the project came out to meet most of the constraints stated at the beginning of the course.

### What unanticipated problems occurred?
I had enveloped an accumulation of issues while building the Air Quality device. As mentioned before, my signoff validation took me longer than I had expected. The reason for this is mostly because of my difficulty seeing the vision of what the customer wanted for this Sensor Signoff. Many subsections within the document were added later on and took time to research and summarize. 

### What would you do differently if you were to do it over again?
There are many things I would do differently if I had the opportunity for the class. First, I would communicate with the members of the team to understand the importance of meeting together outside of the scheduled meeting routine with our customer. This would make the time for every assignment due for the course be used more efficiently. Also, I would have spent a ton of more time doing more work for the signoff document that I was responsible for. I did not realize the amount of time to be allocated for this one document for it to be valid before purchase.

### What “best practices” have you identified?
The best practices I have noticed through this course would be to make sure everyone, including the professor and customer is on the same page. As a team, it is their own responsibility to communicate correctly and effectively in order to explain a concept that both the engineer and layman can understand. Not only meeting outside of regular meetings with the teacher and customer, but also keeping track of what work has been and is being done at that time will give the group a better analysis of the situation at hand.

### What words of wisdom would you pass on to future students?
It is important to know what type of people you are going to work with for this project. Since this project is an option to be on your own resume, it is also paramount that a high level of seriousness and motivation must be executed. Doing the best you can for your grade as well as the team’s grade is the best case scenario for this course.

### What new knowledge or skills did you acquire throughout capstone?
I have learned many things over the course of our CAPSTONE project. One thing I learned is if I do not know the specifics on what the customer would want for a subsystem of the project, it makes it more difficult to know what to build or even research. Understanding the functionality of the subsystem that’s assigned to a team member can help better realize what the building block of the project should look like. For me, I didn’t know there are classifications for sensors that detect gasses in its location. After researching the advantages and disadvantages of each type, I could figure out which one works best for the project accomplishments.

### Reflect on the project, both technical and organizational. What went well? What didn’t go well?
Technically this project did not meet all its goals. With this in mind I think the implementation and work done on what is complete is fairly good considering multiple subsystems were not designed and implemented until very late in the process. Obviously, our team struggled with deadlines and participation but the rally by some members to complete what we could and present a final interaction that wasn’t lacking a majority of critical features was one of the best moments of the project due to the feeling of completion and multiple parts coming together and working as intended. 
### What unanticipated problems occurred?
A number of unanticipated problems procured throughout the project. Technically, the biggest unanticipated problem was with getting the USB to initialize properly. We expected this to be implemented fairly quickly and it devolved into several long days of working through library code and changes until we could initialize and write to the USB. We also had major unexpected problems within the team. Group members were absent for large portions of the course and their work was not complete weeks after the due date. This was eventually dealt with by portions of the project being dropped and other aspects were picked up by the rest of the team. 
### What would you do differently if you were to do it over again?
I would absolutely be more forward with communication with the professor and supervisor about group conditions and would have been more proactive in doing the work of others when their work or lack thereof was detrimental to the team. I would also have been more proactive in my own work. While I turned a lot of my stuff in on time, I wasn't happy with the amount of work in the amount of time that I left myself with and in the future will definitely begin project oriented tasks well in advance.
### What “best practices” have you identified?
I found it best practice to pester for lack of a better word. Going to our supervisor and going through the documents with him and getting verbal feedback right there helped much more than the intermittent feedback given through GitHub. I also found it best practice to send meeting times in discord even when the meeting was organized in person because people tend to not show up. 
### What words of wisdom would you pass on to future students?
Words of wisdom I would pass on would be to make sure your group is working consistently and on time. Don’t be afraid to talk to the professor for help in any regard; whether it’s a technical question or about team dynamics. Don’t sit idle in this class, if you finish a section before it is due go ahead and start on the next part you never know if unexpected issues arise and take a week of effort to resolve.
### What new knowledge or skills did you acquire throughout capstone?
I acquired a lot of knowledge and skills around working on a project in a team environment. I saw both facets of teamwork from the extremely bad parts of group work where you feel like you are the only one doing work to the good parts where you're sitting next to your teammate figuring out complex topics and getting them to work. The biggest lesson learned from this was that no matter the group dynamic, or the effort they put in, the work is a reflection on you and you should put forth the effort that makes the work a good reflection on you. If this means doing the work of others, then do it and let the person in charge know that they aren't completing their work. In terms of knowledge gained, I learned a lot about expectations and processes in engineering design and what I need to show during it.

### Reflect on the project, both technical and organizational. What went well? What didn’t go well? 
Communication and teamwork went poorly throughout the semester. 
### What unanticipated problems occurred? 
Lack of parts ordered impacted experimentation and gaps in communication between team members and supervisors. 
### What would you do differently if you were to do it over again? 
I would start the entire process of getting signed off during capstone 1 and heavily encourage my team members to do this as well. This process is the first major hurdle of capstone 2, but everything after this grade would be a smoother process. 
### What “best practices” have you identified? 
Scheduled meeting times outside of the weekly supervisor meetings is a must for success. Another best practice would be consistent daily group communication to ensure everyone knows deadlines and what they need to be doing. Checking on each group member and ensuring no one is struggling and needs.
### What words of wisdom would you pass on to future students?
Start everything whether it's a sign off, purchasing, experimentation, or prototyping as soon as possible instead of waiting because you don't have 100 % certainty that you will be signed off quickly or all your parts will come in on time. Account for scenarios and possibilities outside of your control. 
### What new knowledge or skills did you acquire throughout capstone?
At a basic level I learned the fundamental engineering process of taking an idea, making it real, and meticulously documenting every step and detail along the way. In doing this I learned better approaches for working in teams, technical writing, and how to research and parse useful information.
