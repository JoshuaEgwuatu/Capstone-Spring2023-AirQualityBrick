This code was for testing the maximum sample rate of the Arduino Mega 2560 when sampling a generic sensor.

### Functions
1. Setup the sensor and allow for warmup.
2. Mark the start time.
3. Begin sampling from the sensor as often as possible.  Increment counter each time.
4. Stop after 1 second and display the final counter results.

### Dependent Libraries
1. Arduino IDE

### Installation
1. Download and install latest version of the Arduino IDE
2. git clone the required libraries
3. git clone the target file
4. Launch Arduino and open the target file
5. Set the port to target the Arduino Mega
6. Compile and Upload
