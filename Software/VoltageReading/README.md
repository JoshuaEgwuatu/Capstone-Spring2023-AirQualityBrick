This code was for reading the voltage output of the ADC from an analog pin connected to a sensor.  

### Functions
1. To initialize analog pins
2. Read the ADC value from the analog pin
3. Convert analog value back to a voltage


### Dependent Libraries
1. Arduino's IDE


### Installation
1. Download and install latest version of the Arduino IDE
2. git clone the required libraries
3. git clone the target file
4. Launch Arduino and open the target file
5. Set the port to target the Arduino Mega
6. Compile and Upload Arduino code
