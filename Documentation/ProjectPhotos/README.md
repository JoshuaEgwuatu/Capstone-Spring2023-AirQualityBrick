Box 1 is the original design of a simple 3D printed enclosure with a vent on the bottom.  The electrical components are placed inside the enclosure and then has the vent screwed into place.  The top half is sealed to prevent water damage from rain.

Box 2 is the current design of a custom 3D printed enclosure with vents on the bottom and holding space for the battery and solar panels.  Electrical components are placed inside the enclosure.  The solar and battery are placed on top of the interior and into their holding unit.  The holding unit should then be screwed into place on top of the elctronics.

GUTS is the current electrical components that are placed inside one of the enclosures.  Included in the GUTS are the Arduino Mega 2560 Rev. 3, quality sensors, ESP8266, and interface.
