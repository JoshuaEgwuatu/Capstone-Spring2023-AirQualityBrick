# Sensor Experimentation
* The code for these tests can be found under the software section with similar names to the test themselves

### What is Being Tested
1. Performance of Sensors
    - HW-123 MPU-6050 Detection Sensor
      - Gyroscope Sensor
    - Sharp 2YOA21
      - -Distance Sensor
2. Modularity of Sensors
### What isn’t being tested
1. Air Quality Sensors
    - This is due to the fact that the originally planned sensors didn’t make it through the ordering phase.

2. Sensor start-up times
    - These were taken out of consideration due to the sensors being needed not being available

3. Microcontroller communication protocol
   - This was taken out of consideration due to it being tested in the microcontroller/communication subsystem

### Test Setup
  - For this test, we will measure the performance of the gyroscope and distance sensors. This will act as a simulation for the sensors we couldn’t acquire.
