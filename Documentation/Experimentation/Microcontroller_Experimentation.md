# Microcontroller Subsystem Experimentation

### What Is Being Tested
1. Writing Speed To USB
2. USB Access Time
3. Sampling Speeds
4. Multiple Sensor Simultaneous Sampling (Analog and Digital)

### What Is Not Being Tested
* Pin count
  * It is not necessary to test the pin count as it is evident that enough pins are available.
* UART
  * It is expected for the UART to be operable
* Signal connections from other subsystems are expected to work
