# Microcontroller Subsystem Experimentation

### What Is Being Tested
1. Writing Speed To USB
2. USB Access Time
3. Excess Memory Available For Future Features
4. Sampling Speeds
5. Multiple Sensor Simultaneous Sampling (Analog and Digital)

### What Is Not Being Tested
* Pin count
 * It is not necessary to test the pin count as it is evident that enough pins are available.
* UART
 * It is expected for the UART to be operable
* Signal connections from other subsystems are expected to work
