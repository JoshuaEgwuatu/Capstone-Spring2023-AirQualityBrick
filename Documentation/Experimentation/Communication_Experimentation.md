# Communication Subsystem Experimentation

### What Is Being Tested
1. Ability to connect to Wi-Fi for sending data to a server on the Internet
2. Throughput for our code

### What Is Not Being Tested
* 3G/4G/LTE abilities
  * 3G services are no longer supported in the U.S.A.  
  * 4G/LTE options are not being implementing in this iteration
* TCP Client
  * HTTP has been chosen for accessing the server instead, so it is sufficient to know that the ESP8266 can do TCP to then achieve a HTTP Client
* UART receiving data and instructions
  * It is expected that UART will be operable from purchase

### Wi-Fi Capabilities
* Test 1 text
* Test 1 table

### Throughput Test
