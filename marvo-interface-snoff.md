## Subsystem Function
The interface will accept a range of sensor classes from analog current,voltage and digital signals and will house a minimum of 3 sensors at a time and output its data to the microcontroller.                                                                                                   
## Subsystem Constraints
Interface must support sensors of different classes that output or receive analog voltage,analog current and digital signals.
